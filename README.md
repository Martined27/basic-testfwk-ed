# Basic-TestFWK

Basic-TestFWK is a lightweight and extensible testing framework designed for creating and running automated test cases in a simple and efficient manner. This framework is ideal for software QA engineers and developers looking for an easy-to-use solution for their testing needs.

## Features

- **Customizable Framework:** Easily adapt the framework to meet the specific needs of your projects.
- **Extensible:** Add new functionalities as needed with minimal effort.
- **Simple Syntax:** Write test cases in a clean and readable format.
- **Integration:** Can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines to streamline automated testing.

## Prerequisites

Before using Basic-TestFWK, ensure the following are installed on your system:

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/)
- Required Python libraries (specified in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Martined27/basic-testfwk-ed.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd basic-testfwk-ed
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running Tests

1. Place your test cases in the designated test directory (e.g., `tests/`).
2. Use the following command to execute all tests:

   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover -s tests
   ```

3. View the test results in the terminal.

### Writing Test Cases

1. Create a new file in the `tests/` directory (e.g., `test_example.py`).
2. Define your test cases using Python's `unittest` module. For example:

   ```python
   import unittest

   class TestExample(unittest.TestCase):
       def test_sample(self):
           self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 2)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       unittest.main()
   ```

3. Save the file and run the tests as described in the "Running Tests" section.
